## About Me

<p>I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Windsor. As a student, I was fortunate enough to work as both a Research Assistant, Teacher Assistant at the University. I also interned as Software Developer at Amazon, where I learned a lot about designing scalable applications and writing maintainable code. By the end of the internship, I created an internal debugging tool for my team and pushed it to production!  I am always working on atleast one side project, so I can continue to learn new things and grow as a developer. I am looking for an opportunity to work in a place where I get to code, solve interesting problems, design solutions and grow as a developer.

So, it's always interesting to find common threads and hopefully discover some principles to navigate through life.

                        <p>Radical behaviourism is the idea that all behaviours can be explained away by conditioning. This leads to the demonstrably false conclusion of humans being born as a ‚Äútabula rasa (blank slate)‚Äù. But, despite its radical foundation, behaviourism still stands as the cornerstone of modern psychology. Behaviourists were the first psychologist to insist psychology should be seen as a science, namely all theories needed to be backed up by experimentations and evaluated on their predictive ability. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Human psychology is always going to be complicated. So, any lens that can deepen our understanding is worth learning.</p>

            <li><details><summary>History</summary>
                <p>I have always seen history as a collection of stories that happen to be true. So, whenever I am researching a historical event, I try to figure out what happened and deepen my understanding of the characters involved. For example, while learning about Julius Caesar's assassination, I tried to figure out why he wanted to conquer Rome. Then I researched his oppositions and analyzed their motivations.</p>
                <p>I would also try to learn more about the setting. For example, the two-consul system seemed weird. How did it start?  Why were they so afraid of a potential dictator. Unlike in a novel, you can follow your curiosity and the story continues to grow. I don't go out of my way to memorize the dates of different events, but the more I learn, the better I get at placing things chronologically.</p>
                <p>I also love history for putting things into perspective. For example, every solution has a tradeoff. By studying proposed alternates, we can learn they were. This helps us in two major ways.</p>
                <p>First, it helps us understand what we lose by discarding the current system. Any new system we create should address problems the old system was handling. If it doesn't, we have to ask ourselves: is the tradeoff worth it? If so, then is there anything we can incorporate from the previous system? An example is our transition from hand-based production to machine production. For context, craftsmen and artisans populated the towns of medieval Europe. Groups of these families banded together based on their profession as guilds. Craft-based guilds began manufacturing products that traditionally belonged to other guilds to increase their influence. For example, some leatherworkers created shoes. As a result, the craft-based guild became more reliant on the merchant guild. As the merchant grew increasingly powerful, masters from other guilds also became merchants, creating a new social class. The merchant class capitalized on technological advancement and created small factories. So, we were now able to produce more things for cheaper. So, if the goal of craftsmen-guild was to make goods, then the new factory system was an upgrade. But, we like making things and we <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/11-091.pdf">like what we make</a>. Controlling when you work gives you a feeling of autonomy and when skill is coupled with creation it fuels our desire to become experts. <a href="https://www.danpink.com/books/drive">Both are vital to engagement</a>.</p>
                <p>In comparison, factory workers <a href= "https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-work-organization-648000/Monumental-construction#ref67035">required less skill and experience than hand-based crafting</a> and families lost control of their business, so workers could no longer set their hours. Working conditions were also horrible. Fortunately, we have come a long way from then.  However, large corporations still employ the majority of workers. And about <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/330017/employee-engagement-rises-following-wild-2020.aspx">1 in 3</a> are engaged in their work. Maybe emphasizing mastery and increasing autonomy is a step to increasing our productivity and well-being.</p>
                <p>Another thing we learn by studying alternates is if we now have the technology to bring an idea to life. One example of this is the electric car, which was replaced with the gas car. But, Tesla was able to find a way to make it work. As a result, they have become legendary.</p>
                <p>Lastly, history is a collection of our experiences as a species. People have come before us. They have struggled. They have made mistakes. History shows us the mistakes we made as societies and as individuals. And I want to learn from them. So I can do better.</p>

### Strengths And Personality tests 

- Personality stabilizes around adolescence (Find source and confirm)
- Point of tests is to brainstorm ideas of things you might potentially be good at then you try to lean into your strength and make a production, in 9-12 months see if things unfolded the way you expected. This method of reflection will allow you to hone in on your strengths and weaknesses
- Explain test and what insight it gives - also try to validate assumptions a bit
- Big 5
- MBTI - basically big 5 
- Grit - basically measure conscientiousness
- Competing Values Framework (CVF)
- Quinn‚Äôs Competing Values 
- Hierarchy of values
- PERMA
- Optimism
- Character Strengths

## FAQ

<p>Questions I have either been asked and had a lot more to say. Or, things I thought a bit about and give insight into who I am.</p>

<details><summary>Why do you like CS?</summary>
<p>As a kid, I always loved puzzles, magic and making up stories, which is why I think I fell in love with Computer Science. </p>

<p>As a coder, it feels like you are continuously solving fun puzzles. You start by analyzing what you know, brainstorming ways to solve the problem and you know when it‚Äôs solved. Analyzing a problem feels like reading a whodunnit book or trying to escape an escape room. You look at each piece of information and try to see if anything can help you. Next, you brainstorm, trying to connect seemingly unrelated ideas. It‚Äôs like looking at a bunch of scrabble pieces, trying to come up with a word alongside the thrill of having a high-value word pop into your head. It‚Äôs those flashes of brilliance where you move from uncertainty to clarity that makes coding exciting. Last, coding refines your thinking by giving you feedback, just like solving puzzles. Unlike puzzles, there often isn‚Äôt one correct answer for coding. But, there are definitely wrong answers and objectively better answers. You can create test cases to set up a puzzle-like environment. Failed tests or broken components expose faulty or noncomprehensive reasoning like incorrect Sudoku boards. So, you get the same feeling of achievement when you get your code working efficiently and correctly. In short, a good portion of coding is like solving puzzles and they are both fun for the same reasons.</p>

<p>Magic has a certain allure:  a seemingly incomprehensible force that can solve a range of problems. Coding is the closest thing we have to magic. Much like magic, computers are mysterious. The more you learn, the more questions you have. Imagine you want to understand what makes up a computer. So, you learn about different computer parts such as RAM, CPU, hard drive and a motherboard. But, that brings up a plethora of questions, such as how can some metal and electricity ‚Äúremember‚Äù things. And, how does the CPU know what to calculate and how do these calculations turn into meaningful output? Once you understand how each part works individually, you still need to learn how they work together. So, avoid drowning in complexity, you learn to view most things as black-boxes. For example, imagine we wanted to print ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù in Python. We would write `print (‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù)`. Instead of worrying about how Python is handling the printing under the hood. As our programs get more complicated, so does the size of our boxes. So, coding is the art of picking magic boxes and connecting them to solve problems. Likewise, writing maintainable code is about combining smaller boxes, so we only have to worry about a few boxes at a time. In summary, coding is a humbling craft, where you spend a lot of time working with pieces you don‚Äôt fully understand, which simultaneously remind you of your ignorance and pique your curiosity.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know anyone that doesn‚Äôt like stories. But I‚Äôve always been obsessed with them. And, writing code and stories is similar in a lot of ways. I love the way stories weave through a slew of disjointed ideas and combine them into something even better. I love watching as my imagination dissects stories into idea and then stitching them up in different ways. Similarly, software is also ubiquitous and mashes together seemingly unrelated concepts. For example, using the ‚Äúgenetic algorithm‚Äù, which was inspired by studying natural selection, to <a href="https://github.com/Aarif123456/KeystrokeDynamicsSpoofer">mimic a user‚Äôs typing pattern</a>. Or, using a basic statistical technique to find <a href="https://github.com/Aarif123456/amazonscrape">good deals on Amazon</a>. Next, stories are our soul, they let us see the world from someone else‚Äôs world and bring us together. The best authors place themselves in the shoes of their audience and guide them to a new perspective. Likewise, coding is an empathetic art. When you code, you have at least two audiences in mind. The first is the compiler, which is like a smart child. It is limited in what it can infer. So, you need to be exact with your instructions. Unlike with people, you don‚Äôt have to worry about their desires and dislikes. But, there are certain things it can do faster, so you try to state things in a way that makes the execution as fast as possible. Your second audience is other developers. Good code is reusable code. Modern applications are too big for one person to create. So, people will read your code. This means you need to learn to see your code as someone coming it across the first times. You need to make educated guess about what they know and document your code accordingly. Reading code takes as much empathy as reading a book. I have lost count of the times I accidentally broke a program because I misunderstood the creator‚Äôs intention behind a certain line or function. So, coding is a lot like writing stories, except you get to create something you can use. </p>

<p>It‚Äôs no surprise that I enjoy coding. But, it‚Äôs hard to explain why you like anything. I hope that by comparing it to other hobbies I‚Äôve made it a little to see why CS is awesome.</p>
